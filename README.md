[Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/react-new-cv-application)
for the React portion of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Assignment

1. Your application should include:
   1. A section to add general information like name, email and phone number.
   1. A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study
      and date of study)
   1. A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main
      responsibilities of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for
      that company)
1. Be sure to include an edit and submit button for each section or for the
   whole CV. The submit button should submit your form and display the value of
   your input fields in HTML elements. The edit button should add back (display)
   the input fields, with the previously displayed information as values. In
   those input fields, you should be able to edit and resubmit the content.
   You’re going to make heavy use of state and props, so make sure you
   understood those concepts.
1. Create a components directory under your src directory and add your
   components.
1. Include a styles directory under your src directory for your CSS files.
   You’ll need to import these in the component files to use them.
1. Push the results and deploy them with any of the options mentioned below. At
this point of the curriculum, it doesn’t matter which platform you choose as
long as your project is live on the internet!
